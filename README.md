## Um pouco do Emerson
Pt-br: ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

My greatest passion is learning, and wherever I go I aim to further develop my skills. I am very extroverted, but when I have to dedicate my time to finish the proposed work, I don't think twice before focusing and seeking completion. I am great working in teams, because I am always the neutral point in groups, I always look for creative ways to captivate group members to create new ideas out of disagreements. I always listen to the feedbacks that are offered to me, because I know that this will only help me grow, bringing back into focus my delight in learning in the first place.

I have a degree in Marketing, but most of my work is focused on brand development and social web design. What made me start studying programming was the desire to learn how to put everything I design into practice with my own hands.
